Hi, I'm Blake Nolan Moore. 
I am a husband & father. 
I live in France, though I grew up in New England.

I'm learning how to code, and how to start a business. 
I'm trained as an electromechanical engineer, with a focus on 3D mechanical design.

I now see how that doesn't perfectly apply to my current focus, but hey.
